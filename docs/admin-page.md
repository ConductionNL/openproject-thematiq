# The admin page

An OpenProject administrator sees which design system styles OpenProject on one page.

## Open it

Open **Administration**, then **Thematiq design**. Only administrators see the menu item and only they can open the page.

OpenProject has its own menu item called "Design". That page belongs to OpenProject's Enterprise edition and is not part of this plugin.

## Check the page after a change to the code

The script `test/integration/admin_page_check.rb` signs in and opens the page. Run it inside a development container, never against an instance people use:

```bash
docker exec -e THEMATIQ_CHECK_PASSWORD='<admin password>' -e THEMATIQ_CHECK_HOST=localhost:8080 openproject-thematiq \
  bash -lc 'cd /app && bin/rails runner /app/custom-plugins/openproject-thematiq/test/integration/admin_page_check.rb'
```
